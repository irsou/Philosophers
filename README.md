## 🚀 Purpose


## Aditional details
- Threads
A thread is sort of a separate "path of execution" within your program. A regular program has a single thread and makes things in a row (sequentially) in it, but several threads can be created in the same program running in parallel, so various things can be made at the same time (concurrently).

- Mutexes (Mutual Exclusion)
A mutex is like a "lock" that protects shared resources. Only a single thread is allowed to "hold the key" at a time.
